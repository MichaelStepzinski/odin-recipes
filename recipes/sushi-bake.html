    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you've been following food trends lately, you've probably stumbled upon the latest sensation: sushi bakes.
        This innovative dish combines the best elements of sushi with the comforting, shareable nature of a casserole,
        creating a culinary experience that's as delicious as it is visually appealing.
    </p>
    <p> At its core, a sushi bake is a layered, oven-baked dish that captures the essence of sushi in a new format.
        Think of it as sushi in casserole form. The base typically consists of seasoned sushi rice, topped with layers
        of fresh fish (like salmon or tuna), creamy sauces (often a blend of mayo and spicy sauce), and crunchy
        toppings. Once baked, it's garnished with fresh veggies and served with crispy nori or rice crackers.
